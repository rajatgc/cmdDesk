            <p style="font-weight: 600;">Dear SpiceJet family, </br></br>
            <p>On May 23, 2005 we flew our very first Boeing 737 aircraft from Delhi to Ahmedabad. Who was to know that day that 17 years later, SpiceJet would still be proudly and tirelessly flying! Facing challenges, weathering storms, inventing and reinventing ourselves- remaining steadfast and strong and dedicated in our service to India.  Today, on our 17th anniversary, we can all proudly say that we have surmounted the biggest challenge faced by the aviation industry in human history. </p>
            <p>As the world is returning to a new normal post-pandemic, India's favourite airline is back to serving its passengers and flying them in India and around the world. As always, we continue to fly with the highest loads month after month and expect to soar even higher in the coming months.</p>
            <p>The Boeing 737 Max – the flagship of our fleet – has successfully returned to service and earned rave reviews from passengers. Over the next few months we will induct many more Max aircraft in our fleet with the goal to replace all our older aircraft with the Max.</p>
            <p>SpiceXpress, our successful cargo company, will add a substantial number of freighters further strengthening and consolidating its leadership position in the industry. 
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>
              We will continue to add new products and new routes to our network this year. SpiceClub, our wonderful loyalty program launched our co-branded credit card recently and we hope to start a broadband internet service on board our aircraft soon. Our route network will also expand to include unique and exciting new destinations in India and around the world. 
            </p>

            <p>
              SpiceJet has been specially recognised for the stellar role you have all played in serving your country through the Covid crisis. We transported more than 100,000 oxygen concentrators to India when they were the most required. We were the first and the largest transporters of Covid vaccines in the country. We played a leading role in reuniting families by flying those stranded around the world during Covid. And we flew back a large number of Indian students stranded in Ukraine during the war by flying to countries and airports that we had never flown to. I am so incredibly proud of all this wonderful work that you have all done! SpiceJet continues ro  proudly fly the Indian flag on its tails and in its heart! 
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you all for your tremendous support all these years and especially for your resilience and perseverance during this testing time. I
could not have asked for and worked with a more dedicated team. You are the reason that SpiceJet stands tall and proud. I am humbled and proud to be working with all of you.
            </p>
        
            <p>
              </br>
              Happy 17th birthday to SpiceJet!
            </p>

              Warm regards to you and your families,
              </br>
